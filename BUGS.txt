This code has a few built-in assumptions and limitations.

Here I will try to document these various "flaws":

For "anniversary" photo selection, photos are assumed to have the date they 
were taken somewhere in their path.  (either in a directory named with the 
date, or the filename itself) Further, this date is assumed to be in either 
`-MM-DD` or `MMDD_` format.

Inconsistency:  "recent" pictures are identified based on file mtime.  But, 
anniversary pictures are identified based on directory/file name, ignoring 
mtime.

The day's list of photos to be displayed is passed to the image display 
program ("fbi") on the command line.  This command could become long 
enough to cause problems. (Note: on my pi, "getconf ARG_MAX" returns
2097152.  The size of a typical day's photo list of 1700 photos is 75-90kB, so
I think the command length would have to be more than 20x longer before it hit
the limit.)

Similarly, photo selection is done by generating "find" commands.  In some 
cases, such as a large number of entries in the "excludes" file, this command 
could become quite long - perhaps long enough to cause problems. This should
only be an issue if one had a very large number of  "excludes" or perhaps a 
very large range of "anniversary" days.

There is no provision for the display to run continuously for a multi-day
period of time. It is assumed that the display will run for no more than 24
hours.  

Only able to access photos via filesystem.  It would be awesome to be able to
access "cloud" photo repositories from Google, Amazon, etc. This would
complicate photo selection.
